# Virtual-Programming-Lab-Examinations
I developed a VPLE (Virtual Programming Lab for Examinations) is a web-based user-friendly application which helps to conduct and assessing the programming assignments during examinations efficiently and effectively.

It is a  web based use friendly Application called VPLE(Virtual Programming 
Lab for Examinations) which helps in conducting and assessing the programming 
assignments during examinations efficiently and effectively & It reduces the time 
taken to assess the during lab examinations. The conductance and evaluation of 
exams would be much simpler and efficient. The system would provide the 
examiner with features to evaluate the submissions automatically with a set of test 
cases and to measure similarity of the submissions. Timely and well organized 
exam conduction would be possible with the use of VPLE. Problem statements 
would be disclosed on time and evaluation of the submitted solutions would be 
systematic. Timely and well organized exam conduction would be possible with the use 
of VPLE. Problem statements would be disclosed on time and evaluation of the 
submitted solutions would be systematic. The system would be fair for everyone 
involved. All the examinees are to submit their results and the exam would be time 
bound. The problems to be solved will be different but are of same standard. The 
examinees are able to write their responses, test their responses, check the timer and 
submit their responses on a simple user friendly application.
